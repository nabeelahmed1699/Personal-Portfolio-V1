## ðŸš¨ Forking this repo (please read!)

**yes, with attribution**.

I value keeping my site open source, but as you all know, _**plagiarism is bad**_. It's always disheartening whenever I find that someone has copied my site without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing this iteration of my website, and I am proud of it! All I ask of you all is to not claim this effort as your own.

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [nabeelahmed](https://nabeelahmed1699.github.io/Personal-Portfolio-V1/#home). Thanks!
